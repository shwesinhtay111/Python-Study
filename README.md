The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
=======================================================================                                                  
    1. Names can not start with a number.
    2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
    3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
    4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
    5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), 
       or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
    6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"      

Numbers

      Integer
      Float
      Expression -> +, -, *, /, %, //, **, num * 0.5
Varible Assignments
====================
      - Python uses dynamic typing, meaning you can reassign variables to different data types
      - Variable assignment follows name = object, where a single equals sign = is an assignment operator
      - Determining variable type with type()Â¶
